Sequence in programming is when the computer reads through a program line bly line and processes the information

```csharp
            Console.WriteLine("enter your marks");
            int marx = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
            if (marx>=60)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("PASSED");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Sorry you have failed");
            }
            Console.ReadLine();
```
